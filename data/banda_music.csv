Banda MS,"No me pidas perdon	 ","Don't ask for forgiveness because I'll fall for it
don't invent lies because I'll believe
don't give me a sorry face
I'm honestly scared that you'll make me return
 
Don't promise that you'll change just to return to my arms
and make a puzzle in my heart
don't ask for forgiveness because I run the risk of forgiving
and I don't want to
 
Don't say sorry because the line is thin between you and desire
the desire to rip off your shirt in seconds and kissing your body
don't say sorry because I'm vulnerable to all your assets
because I still love you
 
Don't ask me to fall for the game of appearances
It's taken me a lot to get on with my life and now you come back
don't say sorry when my present is stable
don't say sorry please I beg you16
because I run the risk of forgiving you.",No Me Pidas Perdón
Banda MS,Me gusta tu vieja,"Buddy, I like your woman
And if you don't like it, we can resolve it
Maybe you don't see it
But her and I, we like each other
And if my comment hurt you
We can even get guns involved
Buddy, I think you're confused
Yo no ando con esa morra
I'm not with that girl
I only like princesses
Stay with that bitc&
Don't forget there's levels
And I do not take a hat
And let's see where that gets us
Disrespectful fucking peasant
Don't offend my woman
Take care of your behavior
Truck driving of the year
With arms in the seat
Do not risk your life
I'm a bully I warned you
Put away your fucking gun
I'm going to leave him in shame
And tomorrow his corpse
It can come out in the press
To cats like you
I do not allow an offense
This guy doesn't know who he's talking to
Naïve guy
You're speaking to the devil
In charge of many people
I have power in the area
And it was not by accident
It's because I have talent
I know who you work for
But I'm worth mother
I'm going to cut his tongue
So that the dog does not bark
Starting today, you're leaving the company
Because your boss is my father",Qué Bendición
Banda MS ,Me vas a extranar,"You will miss me
I swear by whatever you want
That you will look for me
And you will cry
Because you never
Knew to appreciate me
You will remember
All our mischief
But it will be too late...
 
You will miss me
Because love like this
Is not easy to forget
And nobody will know
To do to you all the things
That I did to you
But it was a mistake
To give my heart
To the one not deserving it...
 
(And I swear to you that
You will miss me, shorty)
 
You will miss me
I swear by whatever you want
That you will look for me
And you will cry
Because you never
Knew to appreciate me
You will remember
All our mischief
But it will be too late...
 
You will miss me
Because love like this
Is not easy to forget
And nobody will know
To do to you all the things
That I did to you
But it was a mistake
To give my heart
To the one not deserving it.",Qué Bendición
Banda MS,A lo mejor,"Maybe I'll forget you, maybe never1
maybe I'll think about you, a little more than a little
 
maybe I'll call you at night
maybe you hang up my call
 
I swear I'm not exaggerating
when I tell you that without you I'm nothing
 
maybe you have more pride
maybe I have more problems
 
in remembering that one day you told me
it wasn't worth it to be with me
 
but who forgets the love of their life
in a couple of days, in a couple of nights
 
maybe just you or maybe not even you
maybe if you forget me I was never the love of your life",Con todas las fuerzas
Banda MS,Que Bendicion,"What a blessing to have you with me
And every night for you to be my warmth
What a nice sensation it is to see you, for you I gasp
What a blessing it is to know you love me
Because you tell me it in every look
We're two souls firmly in love
What a blessing it is for you to open the doors of your beautiful body and to enjoy your beauty
I love you in excess from head to toe
Like you there aren't two, for me you're perfect
What a blessing to share everyday the satisfaction of feeling your caresses'
To my heart you bring joy, what a great blessing
It is to have you in my life.
 
What a blessing it is to move forward
Even if the path isn't easy
Always united without anything separating us
What a blessing it is to know you love me
Because you tell me it in every look
We're two souls firmly in love
What a blessing it is for you to open the doors of your beautiful body and to enjoy your beauty19
I love you in excess from head to toe
Like you there aren't two, for me you're perfect
What a blessing to share everyday the satisfaction of feeling your caresses'
To my heart you bring joy, what a great blessing
It is to have you in my life.",Qué Bendición
Banda El Recodo,La mejor de todas,"You're everything I wish for
You're a gift that fell from Heaven2
I want to always be by your side
Even your defects have enamored me
 
And I can't compare you to anything
I haven't met anyone like you
You're the best of them all
To describe you words are unnecessary
 
The protagonist of my new story
The one who's a lover when we're alone
The one who's happy and always present
And who wastes their time only to please me
 
You're something more than the love of my life
You're the motive behind my happiness
When I'm with you time doesn't pass
Because you have everything that makes me fall in love

Banda El Recodo,Vas a llorar por mi,"The same way I loved you, I curse you now...
love becomes hatred, being with you I found out...
I appreciate, truly, that you are not with me...
you are not worth my weeping,
and now I regret to have loved you so much.
 
Today you deny that my kisses made you happy...
the fact that you don't look at me, doesn't hurt a bit...
that for no reason at all you would come back to me...
You love me and you deny it, and although you won't believe it, I no longer need you.
 
My damn luck! Why did I meet you?
Damn be the kisses that you gave me,
damn the caresses with which you made me
addicted to never live without you.
 
Damn be the moment when I met you
because, like an idiot, I fell in love with you,
blessed be your abandonment because, after all,
you will cry for me!
 
My damn luck! Why did I meet you?
